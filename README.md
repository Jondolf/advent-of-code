# [ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

This repository has my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

## ðŸ’» Running the solutions

To run solutions:

```
npm start <year|all> <day|all>
```

### Examples:

```
npm run start 2021 1    # run day 1 of 2021
npm run start all       # run all implemented days of all years
npm run start 2021 all  # run all implemented days of 2021
npm run start all 1     # run the first day of all years
```

## âš™ Generating new days

You can also generate new days from the command line. The folders and files will be created according to given arguments, if they don't already exist.

To generate a new day's folder, solution file and input file:

```
npm run create <year> <day>
```

### Examples:

```
npm run create 2021 8  # create template for day 8 of 2021
npm run create 3264 16  # create template for day 16 of 3264
```
